Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to play against each other by clicking on the boxes to place their marks ('X' or 'O'). The game also includes a reset button to start a new game and a message display to announce the winner or a draw.
